todays todo:


create main event loop - :tick:

build with nob - see how the main event loop is used in ioq3, pretty sure its a common loop used in both server and client.
and both server and client are dlls? so build a dll with an event loop
	- how does io3 differenciate between a server and a client build?
	- how does each server and client acutally start <-

implement SDL events into client event loop

send events from queue to client 

implement server

send events from queue to server
