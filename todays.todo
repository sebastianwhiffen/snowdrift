todays todo:


create main event loop

build with cmake - see how the main event loop is used in ioq3, pretty sure its a common loop used in both server and client.
and both server and client are dlls? so build a dll with an event loop

implement SDL events into client event loop


send events from queue to client 

implement server

send events from queue to server
